On my home page, you will find the "about me" - index.html. 

In the about me, you can use the nav bar to navigate to "portfolio", "contact me", and back to "about me". 

Each HTML file is linked to the other respective HTML files, CSS, Bootstrap, and font awesome.

I assigned classes when necessary to make changes to the styling in the CSS sheet - style.css. 

A footer was added to each of the pages.
